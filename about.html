  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>My name is Declan McDonough and I am a first year student at the University of Rhode Island. <br>
    I graduated from The Wheeler School in Providence, RI in 2017. I like to spend my time creating art, <br>
    especially music and costumes, traveling when I can, and spending time with my truly amazing group of friends. <br>
    But more often than not I spend my time overthinking things and just default to playing video games or something. <br>
    I have been to three continents, and I hope to reach all seven within my lifetime. I am also an avid collector of Lego sets,<br> 
    especially Lego Star Wars. My prized set is my 75252 Ultimate Collector Series Imperial Star Destroyer (pictured below). <br>
    Itâ€™s pretty cool.</p> <br>
