  <h1>Declan McDonough's</h1>
  <h2>Programming Portfolio</h2>
  <p>My name is Declan McDonough and I am a first year student at the University of Rhode Island.<br>
    This site serves as a portfolio containing examples of all the programs I have written during my <br>
    time in the CSC106 course at URI. Links to all javascript programs and apps written by me can<br>
    be found on the javascripts and apps pages respectively. The site itself was written using HTML.
